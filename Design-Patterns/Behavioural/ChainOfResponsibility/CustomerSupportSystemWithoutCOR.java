/**
 * Assume we are building a customer support system for an e-commerce platform, where users raise tickets that can be of various types, such as general inquiries, refund requests, technical issues, and delivery complaints.
 *
 * The following code snippet demonstrates how this functionality might be implemented in a naive way:
 */
import java.util.*;

// SupportService class: Handles different types of support requests
class SupportService
{

    // Method to handle the support request based on the type of issue
    public void handleRequest(String type)
    {
        if (type.equals("general")) {
            System.out.println("Handled by General Support");
        }
        else if (type.equals("refund")) {
            System.out.println("Handled by Billing Team");
        }
        else if (type.equals("technical")) {
            System.out.println("Handled by Technical Support");
        }
        else if (type.equals("delivery")) {
            System.out.println("Handled by Delivery Team");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("No handler available");
        }
    }
}

// Main class: Entry point to test the chain of responsibility pattern
public class Main
{

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Create an instance of SupportService
        SupportService supportService = new SupportService();

        // Test with different types of requests
        supportService.handleRequest("general");
        supportService.handleRequest("refund");
        supportService.handleRequest("technical");
        supportService.handleRequest("delivery");
        supportService.handleRequest("unknown");
    }
}
/**
  :: Issues in the Above Code ::

     * Violation of the Open-Closed Principle -	Every time a new type of request is added, the handleRequest method must be modified, violating the Open-Closed Principle, which states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
     * Monolithic Code - All logic is contained within a single method, making it difficult to maintain, test, and extend the system. Each handler (support team) is tightly coupled with the others.
     * Scalability and Flexibility - As the number of support teams grows, we cannot change the order of processing without modifying the core logic. It makes adding new handlers or changing the order of requests cumbersome.
