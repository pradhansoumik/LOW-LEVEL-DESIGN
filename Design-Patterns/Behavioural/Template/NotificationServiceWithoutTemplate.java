/**
 * Let’s assume we are building a Notification Service where we need to send notifications via multiple channels, such as Email and SMS. Below is a simple way of how it might be implemented:
 */
import java.util.*;

// EmailNotification handles sending emails
class EmailNotification
{

    public void send(String to, String message)
    {
        System.out.println("Checking rate limits for: " + to);
        System.out.println("Validating email recipient: " + to);
        String formatted = message.trim();
        System.out.println("Logging before send: " + formatted + " to " + to);

        // Compose Email
        String composedMessage = "<html><body><p>" + formatted + "</p></body></html>";

        // Send Email
        System.out.println("Sending EMAIL to " + to + " with content:\n" + composedMessage);

        // Analytics
        System.out.println("Analytics updated for: " + to);
    }
}

// SMSNotification handles sending SMS messages
class SMSNotification
{

    public void send(String to, String message)
    {
        System.out.println("Checking rate limits for: " + to);
        System.out.println("Validating phone number: " + to);
        String formatted = message.trim();
        System.out.println("Logging before send: " + formatted + " to " + to);

        // Compose SMS
        String composedMessage = "[SMS] " + formatted;

        // Send SMS
        System.out.println("Sending SMS to " + to + " with message: " + composedMessage);

        // Analytics (custom)
        System.out.println("Custom SMS analytics for: " + to);
    }
}

class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Create objects for both notification services
        EmailNotification emailNotification = new EmailNotification();
        SMSNotification smsNotification = new SMSNotification();

        // Sending email notification
        emailNotification.send("example@example.com", "Your order has been placed!");

        System.out.println(" ");

        // Sending SMS notification
        smsNotification.send("1234567890", "Your OTP is 1234.");
    }
}
/**
 * :: Issues In This Code ::
     * Code Duplication: Both EmailNotification and SMSNotification contain nearly identical logic for rate limit checking, message formatting, logging, and analytics. This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, making the code harder to maintain.
     * Hardcoded Behavior: The behavior for sending emails and SMS is tightly coupled with the send() method. If we need to add a new notification type (e.g., Push Notification), we would need to duplicate the entire logic and modify each notification class.
     * Lack of Extensibility: If we need to change the logic for rate limit checks, logging, or analytics, we will have to modify it across all notification classes, leading to potential errors and inconsistencies.
     * Maintenance Overhead: With each new notification type, you are adding more classes with similar code, making the system increasingly difficult to manage as it grows.
