/**
 * Issues with the Code:

     * Doesn't Follow Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): The classes PhysicalProduct, DigitalProduct, and GiftCard contain both business logic and actions that should ideally be in separate classes. For example, printing invoices and calculating shipping costs or discounts are two separate responsibilities, but they're tightly coupled inside the same class.
     * Product Type Checking in the Client Code: In the client code, we are performing checks like instanceof PhysicalProduct, instanceof DigitalProduct, and so on. This violates the Open-Closed Principle (OCP), as adding a new product type would require modifying this client code. Ideally, we want to avoid such checks by delegating the operation logic to the product classes themselves.
     * Lack of Flexibility: Adding a new product type in the future (say, SubscriptionProduct) would require modifying the Client Code, which is not ideal for scalability. Every time a new product is added, the client code would have to be changed to account for new logic.
     * Tight Coupling: The product classes are tightly coupled to the specific operations (printing invoices, calculating shipping costs, and applying discounts). If you want to add more operations, you'd have to modify each product class, which can lead to a codebase that's hard to maintain.
